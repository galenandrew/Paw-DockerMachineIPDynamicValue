Paw Extension - Docker Machine IP Address Dynamic Value
---
This is a [Dynamic Value Paw Extension](https://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/?extension_type=dynamic_value) that returns the IP address for a given Docker Machine.

**NOTE: This is a proof-of-concept extension and is currently not functional due to limitations of the Paw JavaScript API.**
