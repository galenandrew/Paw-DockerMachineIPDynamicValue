Paw Extension - Docker Machine IP Address Dynamic Value
---
This is a [Dynamic Value Paw Extension](https://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/?extension_type=dynamic_value) that returns the IP address for a given Docker Machine.

_Example Using This For a `HOST` Environment Variable_

![Docker Machine IP - Default](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796368/11540736/2014b704-98f4-11e5-9306-3da6f5aaa54e.png)
![Docker Machine IP - Custom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796368/11540737/20285002-98f4-11e5-8917-a689fd32b943.png)

**NOTE: This is a proof-of-concept extension and is currently not functional due to limitations of Paw Extensions ([reference](https://github.com/luckymarmot/Paw-Documentation/issues/20)).**
